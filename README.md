# ðŸ¥§ðŸ“¡ Anti/PieRay Helper

- Setup bind for [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) mod [Coordinates](https://lunarclient.dev/apollo/developers/mods/coordinates) to "Copy Coords to Clipboard".
- Move to a "corner" showing the entity in PieChart, but where the entity is missing from PieChart in the adjacent chunks in the X and Z directions.
- Copy the coordinates to the clipboard and the corner will be added.
- Find two more corners: one with the same X chunk coordinate, one with the same Z chunk coordinate.
- The solution is added.
